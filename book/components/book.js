      <h1>Meta Inventor Artificial Intelligence</h1>
      <p>
      Artificial Intelligence which invents, designs, develops, tests by itself (meta). The AI learns to code on any language and can code full stack and deep learning algorithms by description on human language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am researcher/inventor/architect/teacher/founder/investor/love of “Software Engineer AI”, “MetaAI”: AI which develop AI, full stack, and itself. AI which takes description of application on human language (en, ru, es, etc.) and develops code of the application on programming languages with AI, neural networks, deep learning and so on. AI learns by itself through looking documentation in internet/google. I’m modeling neural networks (strategies) from my brain and brain of other great developers and developing those neural networks in code. I found developers/team who develop the same, and we are develop AI inventor together. AI has voice input/output, accepts different human languages, etc. This Software Engineer AI is absolute model of me and my brain, and even improved model. Also I want create robot who looks and behave like me. All the IT and psychology is in this project. The AI can teach people how to code with the best productivity and performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        MY MISSION is to create AI who develop software better than me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I patented at least 108+ inventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have written a book “Successful Strategies of the Best Software Engineers” with NLP models of developers strategies, hypnotic technics for integration those methods to humans, human design as genetic engine (roles, profiles, gates, genetic keys).

        Questions:
        What is type of neurons should we use? AND, OR, NOT, XOR neurons? Which neurons are good for which tasks?
